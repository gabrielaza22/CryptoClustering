# CryptoClustering
Using Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Question: After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

Answer: After analyzing the results obtained from using the whole data and the controlled data, we can notice that the results are cleaner, more compact, and easier to interpret. The separations between the clusters are slightly more precise because fewer features are used. I conclude that most changes occurred over 24 hours and seven days, while the PCA analysis the opposite results.
